	<h2>La maquina absurda - 2009</h2>
	<p>Project with workshop format done in colaboration with Chris Sugrue during SummerLab 2009<p>
	<p>During SummerLab 2009 we proposed the assistants to think in a piece of a Rude Goldberg machine.</p>
	<p>There were only a rule, each software based piece should be connected to a hardware one. And the first of the elements should be connected to the last one.</p>
    <p>Once the machine was connected each element began to trigger the next in and endless loop... Till one of them broke</p>
    <p>All the ideas for the elements of the machine were thought and created during the week. At the end there were a hairdryer inflating a trash bag triggering a proximity sensor, a little robot wandering around the space who was seen by a camera which produced sounds. A plastic cups telephone transmitting sound from one computer to another. A cloth line moved by motors activated by some software that was looking for a laser projected on a wall. Some particle system visuals generated by lentils jumping on a speaker. And several more.</p>
	<h3>software</h3>
	<p>Most of the pieces were developed using openFrameworks, Processing and Arduino</p>
